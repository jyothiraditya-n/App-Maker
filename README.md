# App-Maker
This was my first ever coding project and I'm sharing it here so y'all can have a jolly laugh. Although the timestamps are extremely questionable on the files, (likely having been reset many times since the original files were zipped to be 'delivered to clients',) I presume that this was written around the tail end of 2015 or the start of 2016 when I was in 8th grade. As you can judge by the context, this code is incredibly poorly written and demonstrates a near-complete lack of understanding about computer programming, as do most first-time coding projects.

I'm mostly sharing it here in continuing the tradition of programmers showing how terrible their past code was to demonstrate how much they've improved. (Although given that it's me we're talking about, it might be worth considering if 'improved' is really the apt word for the situation.)

Anyhow, if you want to run it, clone the repo, read the `usage` file and do what it says. If you have any questions about why it's not working, it's probably good to assume that it never worked in the first place.

Have fun!
